Long-read RNA sequencing technologies are revolutionizing transcriptomic research by providing unparalleled resolution for detecting complex splicing and gene fusion events often missed by conventional short-read RNA-seq methods.
Among these technologies, \gls{ont} \gls{drs} stands out by sequencing full-length RNA molecules directly, preserving native RNA modifications and allowing a more accurate and comprehensive analysis of RNA biology.
This approach bypasses the inherent limitations of cDNA-based sequencing methods, such as artifacts arising from reverse transcription, template switching, and \gls{pcr} amplification~\cite{garalde2018highly, jain2022advances}.

Despite these advantages, a critical question remains: Does \gls{ont} \gls{drs} introduce technical artifacts?
A previous study has suggested that \gls{drs} might generate chimera artifacts, leading to multi-mapped reads~\cite{smith2020molecular}.
These artifacts may result from ligation during library preparation or chimeric reads produced by software missing the open pore signal, potentially confounding downstream analyses such as transcriptome assembly, quantification, and detection of alternative splicing and gene fusion events.
Detecting these chimera artifacts is challenging because long-read aligners often produce chimeric alignments from such artifacts that are indistinguishable from those derived from true gene fusion events.
Importantly, chimeric read artifacts frequently contain internal adapter sequences~\cite{smith2020molecular}, which could theoretically serve as a distinguishing feature to differentiate them from true gene fusion-derived reads.
However, \gls{ont} \gls{drs} basecallers, trained in RNA, struggle to properly call these DNA-based adapter sequences under an RNA model~\cite{liu2024sequencing}.
As a result, current adapter detection tools cannot exploit this feature to eliminate chimeric read artifacts, leaving the issue unresolved.

To address these challenges, we developed DeepChopper, a \gls{glm} for long-read sequence analysis. Leveraging recent advances in \gls{llm} that can interpret complex genetic patterns~\cite{benegas2024genomic}, DeepChopper processes long genomic contexts with single-nucleotide resolution. This capability enables precise identification of \gls{ont} adapter sequences within base-called long reads, facilitating the detection and removal of chimeric read artifacts in \gls{drs} data. Through analysis of both existing and newly generated \gls{drs} data, including those using the most recent RNA004 chemistry, we uncovered the prevalence of chimera artifacts—a critical issue previously overlooked in the long-read sequencing field. We demonstrated that these artifacts significantly impact transcriptomic analysis by complicating gene fusion detection, transcript annotation, and alternative splicing studies. By both identifying and addressing this problem, our work enhances the reliability and precision of \gls{drs} data, substantially improving its utility in transcriptomic research.

\section{Results and Discussion}
\subsection{DeepChopper Architecture and Training}
DeepChopper integrates the \gls{lcglm} HyenaDNA~\cite{nguyen2024hyenadna}, optimized for efficient long-range dependency modeling, with a residual block and a \gls{mlp} for fine-grained sequence analysis.
This hybrid architecture enables both broad context understanding and precise single-nucleotide resolution~\cite{poli2023hyena, he2015deep} (\figref{fig:f1}{a}).
Additionally, DeepChopper incorporates base quality score information to improve prediction and employs an adaptive tokenization strategy that preserves single-nucleotide resolution while capturing higher-order sequence patterns (See \hyperref[sec:methods]{Methods} for details). Through this comprehensive approach, DeepChopper effectively split reads containing internal adapters into multiple records while trimming adapters at the $3'$ ends, thereby preserving authentic biological sequences and eliminating chimera artifacts (\figref{fig:f1}{a}).

Compared to existing general-purpose \glspl{glm} like DNABERT2~\cite{zhou2023dnabert2} and Nucleotide Transformer~\cite{dalla2023nucleotide}, DeepChopper is specifically designed for long-read sequence analysis. It processes up to 32 kilobase pairs, a sufficiently long context to capture most mRNAs, and employs single-nucleotide tokenization to identify non-human reference sequences, such as \gls{ont} adapters, with base-pair precision. Its efficient architecture—using only 7 million parameters—makes DeepChopper computationally practical for large-scale \gls{drs} analysis, in contrast to resource-intensive models like Evo~\cite{nguyen2024sequence}, which rely on billions of parameters. This combination of long context processing, high-resolution accuracy, and computational efficiency makes DeepChopper particularly well-suited for analyzing massive long-read sequences.

\end{figure}

To train DeepChopper for identifying adapter sequences within \gls{drs} long reads, we utilized data from six human cell lines: HEK293T, A549, HCT116, HepG2, K562 and MCF-7 provided by the \gls{sgnex}~\cite{chen2021systematic}.
We curated a training set of 540,000 long reads initially deemed free of adapters and inserted putative adapter sequences, derived from the raw \gls{drs} data, into these reads to create instances containing internal and $3'$ end adapters (See \hyperref[sec:methods]{Methods} for details).
An independent test set comprising 60,000 long reads was held out for performance evaluation.
DeepChopper achieved recall, precision, and F1 scores above 0.99 (\edfigref{fig:sf1}{a}), demonstrating its high accuracy in detecting adapter sequences.
To further assess DeepChopper’s ability to detect chimera artifacts in real data, we generated an additional \gls{drs} dataset using the prostate cancer VCaP cell line, which was not included in the training data.
This independent dataset provides a robust framework for evaluating chimera artifacts in genuine \gls{drs} samples, ensuring that DeepChopper's performance generalizes beyond the training data.

\subsection{Chimeric Read Artifact Detection}

We conducted \gls{drs} of VCaP cells using \gls{ont}'s SQK-RNA002 chemistry, consistent with that used in the \gls{sgnex} project.
Using a MinION sequencer with four R9.4 flow cells, we generated a total of 9,177,639 long reads in FASTQ format, with base-calling performed by \gls{ont}'s Dorado software~\cite{dorado2023}.
DeepChopper was then applied for adapter trimming and correction of chimeric read artifacts.
Notably, DeepChopper increased the yield of long-read sequences by 3\%, resulting in a final output of 9,357,913 long reads.
DeepChopper identified 8,218,172 adapter sequences within 7,990,102 long reads, accounting for 87\% of the raw reads.
Most of these adapter sequences were approximately 70 bp in length (\figref{fig:f1}{b}), aligning with the expected length of the RMX adapter used in \gls{ont} SQK-RNA002 \gls{drs} kit, as specified in the kit's technical documentation~\cite{nano2017tech}.

We then analyzed the positions of DeepChopper identified adapter sequences within each long read.
Among these, 212,478 reads contained internal adapters, while 7,777,624 reads had adapters at their $3'$ ends (\figref{fig:f1}{c}).
This reveals that chimeric read artifacts, evidenced by internal adapters, are present in VCaP \gls{drs} data and may reflect a common problem inherent to \gls{drs} long reads.
Further examination of adapter-trimmed reads showed that chimera artifacts could arise from the joining of multiple long reads, with the most prevalent type involving two reads connected by an internal adapter to form a single chimeric read (\figref{fig:f1}{d}).

To validate the chimeric read artifacts identified by DeepChopper in the VCaP \gls{drs} data, we analyzed the chimeric alignments generated by minimap2~\cite{li2018minimap2}, as chimeric reads typically produce such alignments.
To distinguish genuine chimeric reads from artifacts, we generated nanopore direct cDNA sequencing data for VCaP cells and considered chimeric reads with alignments fully supported by cDNA sequencing as bona fide (See \hyperref[sec:methods]{Methods} for details).
Additionally, we assessed whether the adapter trimming function of \gls{ont}'s Dorado basecaller could mitigate chimeric read artifacts.
While Dorado's adapter trimming had no effect on reducing chimeric alignments, DeepChopper achieved a 91\% reduction and increased the proportion of cDNA-supported chimeric alignments from 5\% to 47\% (\figref{fig:f1}{e}).
To further confirm the nature of the identified chimeric read artifacts, we examined the base quality scores of the internal adapter sequences identified by DeepChopper and aligned them with the human reference genome using \gls{blat}~\cite{kent2002blat}, a tool known for its high alignment accuracy.
Our analysis revealed that the adapter sequences from the chimeric read artifacts exhibited low base quality scores (\figref{fig:f1}{f}) and poor alignment identity with the human reference genome (\figref{fig:f1}{g}), confirming their artifactual nature and non-human origin.

\subsection{Cross-platform Validation}

To comprehensively assess DeepChopper’s performance in reducing chimera artifacts in \gls{drs}, we examined cDNA-supported chimeric alignments in the \gls{sgnex} samples.
DeepChopper significantly reduced chimeric alignments by 62\% to 84\%, while preserving cDNA-supported chimeric alignments without noticeable reduction (\figref{fig:f1}{h}), indicating the prevalence of chimeric read artifacts in \gls{drs}.

To further validate DeepChopper's accuracy, we applied it to process \gls{drs} data from the human WTC11 induced pluripotent stem cell line, generated by the \gls{lrgasp} project~\cite{pardo2024systematic}.
Additionally, the \gls{lrgasp} project generated cDNA-based long-read sequencing data from this cell line using distinct protocols (\gls{pcr}-cDNA, CapTrap, R2C2) on both \gls{ont} and \gls{pb} platforms, providing a valuable resource for benchmarking DeepChopper's performance.
We observed that DeepChopper consistently eliminated only the chimeric alignments in the \gls{drs} data that were not supported by any cDNA-based sequencing method (\figref{fig:f1}{i}), demonstrating its precise ability to distinguish genuine chimeric reads from artifacts.

Recently, \gls{ont} released a new SQK-RNA004 chemistry for \gls{drs}, but it remains unclear whether chimera artifacts persist with this update.
To investigate, we generated \gls{drs} data using the latest SQK-RNA004 kit for the VCaP cell line and performed zero-shot predictions of chimera artifacts using DeepChopper, despite the adapter sequence pattern of RNA004 not being included in its training.
DeepChopper reduced chimeric alignments by 21\% compared to Dorado's base-called and adapter-trimmed long reads, increasing the proportion of cDNA-supported chimeric alignments from about 25\% to 30\% (\edfigref{fig:sf1}{b}).
Furthermore, the internal adapter sequences identified by DeepChopper within these RNA004 chimeric read artifacts exhibited low base quality scores (with a mean of 7.8) and low \gls{blat} identity (mean of 0.38) (\edfigref{fig:sf1}{c}).
These findings strongly suggest that chimera artifacts continue to be an issue with the latest RNA004 \gls{drs} kit.

\subsection{Impact on Downstream Analysis}

To investigate potential factors contributing to the formation of chimera artifacts, we examined the expression levels and sizes of the genes involved in these artifacts, we found that genes affected by chimera artifacts exhibited significantly higher expression levels compared to all expressed genes (\(\textrm{p-value} < 2.2 \times 10^{-16}\)) (\edfigref{fig:sf2}{a}), while following a similar size distribution pattern (\edfigref{fig:sf2}{b}).
We then analyzed the genomic patterns of improper connections generated by chimera artifacts across chromosomes in VCaP \gls{drs} data.
These artifacts showed varying frequencies across chromosomes, with the mitochondrial chromosome (Chr M) exhibiting an especially high rate of connections per base pair, indicating it may be a hotspot for chimera artifact formation (\figref{fig:f2}{a}).
A similar pattern of improper inter-chromosomal connections was also observed in VCaP RNA004 \gls{drs} data (\edfigref{fig:sf2}{c}), suggesting that chimera artifacts may be an inherent issue of \gls{drs} technology, rather than being fully resolved by improvements in sequencing chemistry.

To evaluate the influence of chimera artifacts on downstream analyses, we investigated the impact of DeepChopper-mediated correction on transcript annotation.
IsoQuant~\cite{prjibelski2023accurate} was employed to detect and annotate transcripts from VCaP \gls{drs} data, focusing on chimeric read artifacts identified by DeepChopper.
By comparing transcript identification with and without DeepChopper correction, we observed an approximately 2-fold increase in the number of identified transcripts (\figref{fig:f2}{b}).
Similar results were also noted for VCaP RNA004 \gls{drs} data (\edfigref{fig:sf2}{d}).
The most prominent increase occurred in the full-length transcripts (\gls{fsm} category), with additional improvements observed across alternatively spliced transcripts (\gls{ism}, \gls{nic}, and \gls{nnc} categories).
These findings underscore the effectiveness of DeepChopper in mitigating the detrimental effects of chimera artifacts on transcript annotation.

Next, we assessed whether DeepChopper could improve gene fusion detection by correcting chimera artifacts. Gene fusion calls identified by FusionSeeker~\cite{chen2023gene} from DeepChopper-processed \gls{drs} reads exhibited an 89\% reduction compared to those detected from Dorado's adapter-trimmed reads.
To further evaluate this reduction, we applied Arriba~\cite{uhrig2021accurate} to detect gene fusions using short-read RNA-seq of VCaP cells and found that none of the gene fusion calls reduced by DeepChopper were supported by those detected in RNA-seq data (\figref{fig:f2}{c}).
This demonstrates that DeepChopper effectively reduces false positive gene fusion calls caused by chimera artifacts in \gls{drs}, an essential improvement for accurately identifying gene fusion drivers in cancer transcriptomes.

Upon closer examination of the chimera artifact-derived gene fusion calls, we found a notable enrichment of ribosomal protein genes (\edfigref{fig:sf3}{a}).
\gls{go} enrichment analysis in VCaP (\figref{fig:f2}{d}) and \gls{sgnex} cell lines (\edfigref{fig:sf3}{b}) confirmed that housekeeping ribosomal protein genes are frequently involved in these artifacts.
Additionally, ribosomal protein genes were also enriched in the chimera artifacts associated with RNA004 chemistry (\edfigref{fig:sf3}{b}).
A manual inspection of a chimeric read identified as an RPS29-COX8A fusion, involving the 40S ribosomal protein S29 in VCaP \gls{drs} data, revealed that the DeepChopper-processed region aligned with raw current signals showing low intensity, indicative of \gls{ont} adapters (\figref{fig:f2}{e}).
The presence of polyA and open pore signals at the boundary of this region further suggested that this chimeric read resulted from improperly joined mRNA transcripts, rather than representing a genuine gene fusion event.

In conclusion, DeepChopper demonstrates the effective application of language models in long-read sequence analysis by addressing the previously unrecognized issue of chimera artifacts in nanopore \gls{drs}. By precisely identifying and removing \gls{ont} adapters from base-called long-read sequences, DeepChopper substantially improves \gls{drs} data quality, allowing for more accurate transcript and gene fusion analyses. Beyond its immediate application in enhancing \gls{drs} data integrity, this work establishes a practical framework for applying language models to resolve complex challenges in long-read sequencing technologies. Looking forward, DeepChopper could be adapted to detect additional artifact types or expanded to support other aspects of long-read analysis, ultimately advancing capabilities across diverse research domains.

\section{Methods}\label{sec:methods}

\subsection{Cell culture}

VCaP cell line was obtained from the \gls{atcc} and cultured under sterile conditions to maintain optimal growth and viability.
The cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, high glucose; Gibco, Cat\# 11-965-092) supplemented with 10\% fetal bovine serum (FBS Opti-Gold, Performance Enhanced, US Origin; Gendepot, Cat\# F0900-050) to provide essential growth factors.
In addition, the culture medium was enriched with \SI{5}{\ml} of 100 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Gendepot, Cat\# CA017-010) to support cellular metabolism and \SI{5}{\ml} of Antibiotics-Antimycotics (\( 100\times \)) (Gendepot, Cat\# CA002-010) to prevent microbial contamination.
Cells were cultured in \SI{100}{\mm} cell culture treated dishes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat\# 12-556-002) and incubated at \SI{37}{\degreeCelsius} in a humidified atmosphere containing 5\% CO2, with media changes performed every 72 hours to ensure nutrient availability and waste removal.
Cell confluency was regularly monitored and subculturing was performed before reaching 80\% confluency to maintain healthy growth conditions and prevent over-confluence stress.

\subsection{RNA extraction and quantification}

Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Cat\# 74104) according to the protocol of the manufacturer.
The quality and concentration of RNA were assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.
Poly(A)+ RNA was then enriched from total RNA using the Dynabeads\textsuperscript{tm} mRNA Purification Kit (Invitrogen, Cat\# 65001), which utilizes oligo (dT) beads for selective mRNA binding.
The mRNA was quantified using a Qubit 4 fluorometer and a Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat\# Q32852).
The mRNA preparations were either immediately used to prepare a sequencing library or frozen and stored at \SI{-80}{\degreeCelsius} until further use.

\subsection{Nanopore sequencing}

We performed nanopore \gls{drs} sequencing of the enriched mRNA using two different sets: the RNA002 kits with R9.4.1 flow cells and the RNA004 kits with R10.4.1 flow cells.
The decision to incorporate the RNA004 kit, a newly released option, was driven by our intention to test its capabilities in conjunction with our DeepChopper tool to optimize data quality and sequencing efficiency.
For the RNA002 library, \SI{1}{\micro\gram} of poly(A)+ RNA was used as input for library preparation using the Direct RNA Sequencing Kit (SQK-RNA002, \gls{ont}) following the manufacturer's instructions.
Nanopore \gls{drs} employs a \gls{rta} that typically binds to the poly(A) tails of \gls{mrna}; subsequently, a sequencing adapter is ligated to the \gls{rta}, which guides the mRNA through the nanopore for sequencing.
The prepared library was loaded onto four MinION R9.4 flow cells (FLO-MIN106) and sequenced for 48 hours using the Oxford Nanopore MinION device.
For the RNA004 library, 300 ng of poly(A)+ RNA was used as input for library preparation using the Direct RNA Sequencing Kit (SQK-RNA004, \gls{ont}) according to the protocol of the manufacturer.
The library was then loaded onto a PromethION RNA Flow Cell (FLO-PRO004RA) and sequenced on the Oxford Nanopore PromethION device for 72 hours.

For Direct cDNA sequencing, we utilized the Direct cDNA Sequencing Kit (SQK-DCS109, \gls{ont}) following the manufacturer's protocol.
Briefly, \SI{5}{\micro\gram}  of total RNA was used as input for first-strand cDNA synthesis using Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the SSP and VN primers provided in the kit.
To eliminate potential RNA contamination, we treated the sample with RNase Cocktail Enzyme Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Second-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out using LongAmp Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs).
The resulting double-stranded cDNA underwent end-repair and dA-tailing using the NEBNext Ultra End Repair/dA-Tailing Module (New England Biolabs).
Subsequently, sequencing adapters were ligated to the prepared cDNA using Blunt/TA Ligase Master Mix (New England Biolabs).
Between each enzymatic step, the cDNA and libraries were purified using AMPure XP beads (Agencourt, Beckman Coulter).
We quantified the libraries using a Qubit Fluorometer 3.0 (Life Technologies) to ensure adequate concentration and quality.
The final library was loaded onto a MinION R9.4 flow cell and sequenced on the Oxford Nanopore MinION device for 72 hours.

\subsection{Training data preparation}\label{ssec:data}

We acquired \gls{ont} \gls{drs} FAST5 data from the \gls{sgnex} project, which includes six human cell lines: HEK293T, A549, K562, HepG2, MCF7, and HCT116~\cite{chen2021systematic}.
The FAST5 files were converted to POD5 format using the POD5 conversion tool (\url{https://pod5-file-format.readthedocs.io}).
Subsequently, FASTQ files were generated using Dorado (v0.5.2)~\cite{dorado2023} with adapter trimming disabled (\texttt{--no-trim}) and the ``rna002\_70bps\_hac@v3'' model.
The reads were then aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38) using minimap2 (v2.24)~\cite{li2018minimap2} with ONT direct RNA-specific parameters (-ax splice -uf -k14) for optimized alignment. The resulting SAM files were then converted to BAM format, indexed, and sorted using SAMtools (v1.19.2)~\cite{li2009sequence}.
For adapter sequence extraction, we selected primary alignments without supplementary alignments and identified $3'$ end soft-clipped regions as adapter sequences, while aligned regions were considered non-adapter sequences.
To create artificial chimeric reads, we randomly combined two non-adapter sequences with one adapter sequence to create FASTQ records.
The dataset consists of positive examples containing adapter sequences (with a 1:1 ratio of $3'$ end and internal adapters) and negative examples without any adapter sequences, in a 9:1 ratio.
In total, 600,000 data points were generated and divided into training (480,000), validation (60,000), and test sets (60,000) in an 8:1:1 ratio using stratified random sampling.

\subsection{Language model architecture}\label{ssec:lm}

DeepChopper identifies adapter sequences by framing the problem as a token classification task.
The model consists of 4.6 million trainable parameters.
The model tokenizes biological sequences at the single-nucleotide level, treating each nucleotide (\emph{A}, \emph{C}, \emph{G}, \emph{T}, and \emph{N}) as a fundamental unit.
This approach enables fine-grained sequence analysis crucial for distinguishing artificial adapter sequences from native biological sequences.

For each nucleotide token, DeepChopper predicts whether it belongs to an adapter sequence.
The model's architecture is optimized for high-precision identification of adapter sequences within biological data.
At its core, DeepChopper utilizes the HyenaDNA~\cite{nguyen2024hyenadna}, a specialized genomics architecture that serves as the primary feature extractor.
This framework efficiently processes nucleotide sequences to produce rich feature representations with a dimensionality of 256.

These extracted features then pass through a quality block that integrates base quality scores.
The quality block consists of dense layers with residual connections, incorporating sequence quality information to enhance the model's interpretation of the input data.

The enriched features are ultimately fed into a classification head that computes the probability of each token being part of an adapter sequence.
Through binary classification at every nucleotide position, the model labels each token as either adapter or non-adapter sequence, providing a comprehensive analysis of the entire input sequence.


\subsection{Model training}\label{ssec:training}

DeepChopper processes sequences up to 32,770 nucleotides in length, excluding any longer sequences from analysis.
To ensure efficient batch processing, shorter sequences were padded to this maximum length.
The model was trained using a supervised learning approach, utilizing sequences labeled with adapter annotations.
Training was performed in a \gls{hpc} cluster using two A100 \glspl{gpu}.
The batch size was set to 64, and validation was performed every 20,000 steps.
The model with the highest validation F1 score for the base prediction task was selected for subsequent analyses.
Training was carried out over \num{60} epochs, with early stopping applied based on validation performance to mitigate overfitting risks.

The Adam optimizer was used for parameter optimization, with settings of \( \beta_{1} = 0.9 \) and \( \beta_{2} = 0.999 \)~\cite{kingma2014adam}.
A learning rate scheduler was used to reduce the learning rate when validation loss ceased improving, starting with an initial learning rate of \( 2 \times 10^{-5} \).
The cross-entropy loss function was used to update the model parameters, defined as follows:
\[
	\mathcal{L}_{\textrm{BCE}} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} [y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \hat{y}_i)]
\]
where \(\mathcal{L}_{\textrm{BCE}}\) is the binary cross-entropy loss, \(N\) is the total number of tokens in the input sequence, \(y_i\) is the ground true label for the \(i\)-th token, and \(\hat{y}_i\) is the predicted probability for the \(i\)-th token.

The average cross-entropy loss across the mini-batch is computed as:
\[
	\mathcal{L}_{\textrm{BatchBCE}} = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{j=1}^{B} \mathcal{L}_{\textrm{BCE}}(\mathbf{y}_j, \hat{\mathbf{y}}_j)
\]
where \(\mathcal{L}_{\textrm{BatchBCE}}\) is the average binary cross-entropy loss for the mini-batch, \(B\) is the batch size (number of sequences in the mini-batch),  and \(\mathbf{y}_j\) and \(\hat{\mathbf{y}}_j\) are the true labels and predicted probabilities for the \(j\)-th sequence in the batch.

The model evaluation metrics included accuracy, precision, recall and the F1 score, calculated using the following equations:
\begin{align*}
	\textrm{Precision} & = \frac{\textrm{TP}}{\textrm{TP}+\textrm{FP}}                                                     \\
	\textrm{Recall}    & = \frac{\textrm{TP}}{\textrm{TP}+\textrm{FN}}                                                     \\
	\textrm{F1}        & = 2 \times \frac{\textrm{Precision} \times \textrm{Recall}}{\textrm{Precision} + \textrm{Recall}}
\end{align*}

The final selection of the model was based on the optimal performance in the validation set.
The model is implemented by PyTorch (v2.5.0)~\cite{paszke2019pytorch}.
To identify the best hyperparameter configuration, the Hydra (v1.3.2)~\cite{Yadan2019Hydra} framework was used.

\subsection{Sliding window approach for prediction refinement}

To improve the accuracy and smoothness of the predictions, a sliding window approach was implemented.
This method extends the predicted regions and minimizes noisy predictions, aligning with the typical length of adapter sequences observed in the \gls{ont} \gls{drs} data.
The sliding window strategy effectively maintains continuity in regions predicted to contain adapter sequences, preventing fragmented and unrealistic results.

A sliding window size of 21 nucleotides was selected based on empirical optimization, balancing the need for smoothing while retaining sensitivity to shorter adapter sequences.
Within each window, a voting mechanism was applied to refine the predictions.
The final classification $y_i$ for each nucleotide \( x_i \) was determined by the majority vote of all predictions within the window, as defined by the following equation:
\[
	y_i = \begin{cases}
		1 & \text{if } \sum_{j=i-k}^{i+k} p_j > \frac{W}{2} \\
		0 & \text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}
\]
where \(y_i\) is the final prediction for the $i$-th nucleotide, \( W \) is the sliding window size, \( k \) is half the window size (\( k = \frac{W-1}{2}\)), and  \(p_j\) represents the initial predicted label for the \(j\)-th nucleotide within the window, where a value of 1 indicates that the nucleotide is part of an adapter sequence, and a value of 0 indicates that it is part of a non-adapter sequence.

The combination of the sliding window technique and voting-based refinement significantly improved prediction accuracy by smoothing the outputs and reducing false positives, resulting in more reliable data essential for downstream analysis.

\subsection{Post-processing and filtering}

After refining the adapter predictions, four filtering steps were applied to enhance the quality of the final results:
\vspace{.5em}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=2em]
	\item A predicted adapter sequence must be at least 13 nucleotides long. Sequences shorter than this length threshold are not considered valid adapters.
	\item If a read contains more than four adapter sequences, the entire read sequence is retained without any adapter removal.
	\item For reads containing four or fewer adapter sequences, the identified adapters are removed and the read is divided into smaller segments.
	\item Any segments resulting from this process that are less than 20 nucleotides long are discarded.
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{.5em}
Each remaining segment and its corresponding base quality scores are stored as a single read record in the final FASTQ file.
This filtering process separates chimeric read artifacts containing internal adapters into multiple segments, while retaining reads with $3'$ end adapters as single shortened segments.

\subsection{BLAT identity calculation}

The accuracy of DeepChopper in detecting adapter sequences was evaluated by aligning the identified sequences to the human reference genome using \gls{blat}~\cite{kent2002blat}.
A \gls{blat} identity score was defined as the ratio of matched bases to the total sequence length:
\[
	\textrm{BLAT Identity} = \frac{\textrm{Match Length}}{\textrm{Sequence Length}}
\]
In this context, match length refers to the number of bases in the query sequence that align with the reference genome, while sequence length denotes the total length of the query sequence.
This score provides a quantitative measure of how closely each identified sequence aligns with the reference genome, serving as an indicator of detection accuracy.
The alignments were performed using the PxBLAT (v1.2.1)~\cite{li2024pxblat}

\subsection{Validation of chimera artifact reduction}

Cross-platform validation of \gls{drs} chimera artifacts identified by DeepChopper was conducted leveraging \gls{ont} direct cDNA sequencing and additional cDNA-based sequencing platforms.
Direct cDNA sequencing validation was performed using six cancer cell lines, including the VCaP dataset generated in this study and five published datasets (A549, K562, HepG2, MCF7, and HCT116) obtained from the \gls{sgnex} project~\cite{chen2021systematic}.
The direct cDNA data in FAST5 format were converted to POD5 format using the POD5 conversion tool (\url{https://pod5-file-format.readthedocs.io}).
Subsequently, FASTQ files were generated using Dorado (v0.5.2)~\cite{dorado2023} with adapter trimming enabled (\texttt{--trim} adapters) and the ``dna\_r9.4.1\_e8\_hac@v3.3'' model.
The reads were then processed using Pychopper (\url{https://github.com/epi2me-labs/pychopper}, v2.7.9) and Cutadapt (v4.2)~\cite{martin2011cutadapt} according to a published protocol~\cite{grunberger2022nanopore}.
The oriented reads were aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38) using minimap2 (v2.24)~\cite{li2018minimap2} with optimized parameters (-ax splice -uf -k14) for spliced alignment.
The resulting SAM files were then converted to BAM format, indexed, and sorted using SAMtools (v1.19.2)~\cite{li2009sequence}.

Additional cDNA-based long-read sequencing data from the WTC11 (human) and F121-9 (mouse) cell lines were used for further validation, incorporating five distinct platforms: \gls{ont} \gls{pcr}-cDNA, \gls{ont} CapTrap, \gls{ont} R2C2, \gls{pb} cDNA, and \gls{pb} CapTrap.
The raw FASTQ files (and FASTA files for \gls{ont} R2C2) from these datasets were provided by the \gls{lrgasp} project~\cite{pardo2024systematic}.
For the \gls{pcr}-cDNA data, the reads were processed using Pychopper (\url{https://github.com/epi2me-labs/pychopper}, v2.7.9) and Cutadapt (v4.2)~\cite{martin2011cutadapt}, following the protocol described in reference~\cite{grunberger2022nanopore}. \gls{ont} reads were then aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38) or mouse reference genome (GRCm39) using minimap2 (v2.24)~\cite{li2018minimap2} with the parameters (-ax splice -uf -k14), while \gls{pb} reads were aligned using the parameters (-ax splice:hq -uf).
The \gls{ont} \gls{drs} data from A549, K562, HepG2, MCF7, HCT116, VCaP, WTC11 and F121-9 cell lines were processed as previously described, except that The F121-9 cell line data was aligned to the mouse reference genome (GRCm39).

To validate the chimeric alignments derived from \gls{drs}, comparisons were made with chimeric alignments identified from cDNA-based data across the specified platforms. Chimeric alignments, defined by a primary alignment and one or more supplementary alignments, each containing the SA tag in the BAM file, were converted into lists of genomic intervals based on their corresponding alignments. The genomic interval lists were then compared between platforms, and overlapping intervals were considered concordant if the distance difference between them was less than 1000 bp. Supporting rates were calculated as the proportion of \gls{drs} chimeric alignments corroborated by cDNA-based platforms, thereby providing cross-validation of chimera artifacts identified by DeepChopper.

% Sequences longer than 20 bp were aligned to the reference genome using \gls{blat}.
% The resulting identity scores were used to distinguish between true biological sequences and potential chimeric reads, with lower scores indicating likely artificial sequences.
% To evaluate terminal artificial sequences, we employed the \gls{blat} identity threshold of 0.9 to classify hits and non-hits.
% To assess DeepChopper's accuracy in detecting terminal artificial sequences, we compared its predictions to the soft-clipped regions in untrimmed Dorado-processed data.
% An overlap threshold of 0.4 was used to determine the concordance between the two methods.


\subsection{Gene expression analysis and transcript classification}

Gene expression levels from \gls{drs} were quantified using IsoQuant (v3.1.2)~\cite{prjibelski2023accurate}, with the parameters (\texttt{--}data\_type nanopore \texttt{--}stranded forward \texttt{--}model\_construction\_strategy default\_ont \texttt{--}sqanti\_output). The ``\texttt{--}sqanti\_output'' option enables IsoQuant to generate files containing transcript classification information, analogous to the output provided by SQANTI~\cite{tardaguila2018sqanti}.


\subsection{Gene fusion identification and visualization}

For \gls{ont} \gls{drs} data, gene fusions were identified using FusionSeeker (v1.0.1)~\cite{chen2023gene} with default settings.
For short-read RNA-seq data, FASTQ files for the VCaP cell line were obtained from the \gls{ccle} project~\cite{barretina2012cancer} under SRA accession SRX5417211.
Raw reads were mapped to the hg38 reference genome using STAR (v2.7.11)~\cite{dobin2013star}, and gene fusion events were detected with Arriba (v2.4.0)~\cite{uhrig2021accurate}.
The gene structure of the RPS29-COX8A fusion was visualized using GSDS (v2.0)~\cite{hu2015gsds}.
Base quality scores were generated with a custom Python script, and ion current signals were visualized using Squigualiser (v0.6.3)~\cite{samarakoon2024interactive}.
The circos plot for gene fusion events was visualized using chimeraviz (v1.30.0)~\cite{laagstad2017chimeraviz}.

\subsection{GO enrichment analysis}

\gls{go} enrichment analysis of biological processes for genes involved in chimera artifacts identified in \gls{drs} data was performed using the \gls{david} webserver~\cite{sherman2022david}.

\subsection{Computing resource}

All computations were performed on a \gls{hpc} server equipped with a 64-core Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6338 CPU and 256 GB of RAM. The server was also configured with two NVIDIA A100 \glspl{gpu}, each with 80 GB of memory, enabling efficient processing of both CPU-intensive tasks and \gls{gpu}-accelerated deep learning workloads.
